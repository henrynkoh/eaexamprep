## Study Tip of the Month

### Mastering Multiple-Choice Strategy

Many candidates struggle with the EA exam's tricky multiple-choice format. Try this proven technique:

1. **First Pass**: Read the question carefully and try to answer before looking at options
2. **Eliminate Obvious Distractors**: Cross off clearly incorrect choices
3. **Look for Qualifier Words**: Pay attention to "always," "never," "must," etc.
4. **Compare Similar Answers**: When two answers are very similar, one is usually correct

Remember: The EA exam often includes misleading answer choices that are partially correct. Always look for the MOST correct answer.

## Featured Practice Questions

Test your knowledge with these sample questions from our database:

### Part 1: Individuals

**Question**: A taxpayer who is 67 years old and single has AGI of $27,000. What is the maximum amount of charitable cash contributions that can be deducted as an itemized deduction?

A) $8,100
B) $13,500
C) $27,000
D) No limit

<details>
<summary>**Click to see answer and explanation**</summary>
The correct answer is C) $27,000. 

For tax years 2021 through 2023, the limit for cash contributions to qualifying charities is 100% of AGI. This was a temporary increase from the usual 60% limit due to the CARES Act and subsequent extensions. For taxpayers over 65, there are no additional restrictions on this limit.
</details>

### Part 2: Businesses

**Question**: A corporation had accumulated earnings and profits of $50,000 at the beginning of the year. During the year, the corporation had current earnings and profits of $30,000 and made distributions totaling $65,000. What amount of the distributions must shareholders report as dividends?

A) $30,000
B) $50,000
C) $65,000
D) $80,000

<details>
<summary>**Click to see answer and explanation**</summary>
The correct answer is C) $65,000.

Distributions are considered dividends to the extent of the corporation's current and accumulated earnings and profits. In this case, the corporation has current E&P of $30,000 plus accumulated E&P of $50,000, for a total of $80,000. Since the distributions ($65,000) do not exceed this amount, the entire distribution is treated as a dividend.

> "After failing Part 1 twice using textbooks alone, I switched to EA Exam Prep. The difference was immediate - the adaptive learning system identified major gaps in my understanding of basis calculations that my self-study had missed. The mobile app allowed me to study during my lunch breaks, and the simulated exams built my confidence. I passed all three parts within 4 months and just received my EA credential last week!"
