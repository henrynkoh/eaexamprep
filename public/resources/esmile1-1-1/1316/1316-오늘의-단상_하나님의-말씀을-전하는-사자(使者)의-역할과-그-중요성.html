                            <p data-ke-size="size16">안녕하세요. 오늘은 성경에서 하나님의 말씀을 전하는 사자(使者)의 역할과 그 중요성에 대해 살펴보려고 합니다. 성경은 하나님께서 선지자들과 사도들을 통해 그분의 뜻을 전하셨음을 보여줍니다. 그들은 단순히 자신의 생각을 전한 것이 아니라, 하나님으로부터 받은 메시지를 그대로 전달했습니다.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">이는 예수 그리스도께서도 아버지의 뜻을 전하는 궁극적인 사자로 오셨음을 의미합니다. 오늘 우리가 살펴볼 구절들을 통해 하나님의 말씀을 전하는 일의 중요성과 책임에 대해 깊이 생각해 보시기 바랍니다. 이를 통해 은혜복음과 하나님 아는 지식에서 더욱 성장하시길 소망합니다.</p>

<li>Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. 보라, 내가 내 사자를 보내리니, 그가 내 앞에서 길을 예비할 것이요, 또 너희가 구하는 주가 갑자기 그의 성전에 임하시리니, 곧 너희가 사모하는 언약의 사자니라. 보라, 그가 임하시리라. 만군의 여호와가 말하노라[말라기 3:1].</li>
<li>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 내가 내 자의로 말하지 아니하였노라. 나를 보내신 아버지께서 내게 명령하사 내가 무엇을 말하고 무엇을 이를 것을 주셨으니[요한복음 12:49].</li>
<li>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. 그 때에 내가 말하기를, 보소서, 내가 왔나이다. 두루마리 책에 나를 가리켜 기록된 것과 같이 하나님이여, 내가 주의 뜻 행하기를 즐기오니 주의 법이 내 마음에 있나이다 하였나이다[시편 40:7-8].</li>
<li>And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 여호와께서 모세에게 이르시되, 너는 이스라엘 자손에게 이같이 이르라. 내가 하늘로부터 너희에게 말한 것을 너희가 친히 보았느니라[출애굽기 20:22].</li>
<li>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. 하나님이 보내신 이는 하나님의 말씀을 하나니, 이는 하나님이 그에게 성령을 한량없이 주심이니라[요한복음 3:34].</li>
<li>And the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. 여호와께서 그의 손을 내밀어 내 입에 대시며 여호와께서 내게 이르시되, 보라 내가 내 말을 네 입에 두었노라[예레미야 1:9].</li>
<li>The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; 주 여호와의 영이 내게 임하였으니, 이는 여호와께서 내게 기름을 부으사 가난한 자에게 아름다운 소식을 전하게 하려 하심이라. 나를 보내사 마음이 상한 자를 고치며, 포로된 자에게 자유를, 갇힌 자에게 놓임을 전파하며[이사야 61:1].</li>
<li>For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. 나는 아버지께서 내게 주신 말씀들을 그들에게 주었사오며, 그들은 이것을 받고 내가 아버지께로부터 나온 줄을 참으로 아오며, 아버지께서 나를 보내신 줄도 믿었사옵나이다[요한복음 17:8].</li>
<li>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 그가 내게 이르시되, 인자야, 가라. 이스라엘 족속에게 가서 내 말로 그들에게 고하라[에스겔 3:4].</li>
<li>For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 내가 이 책의 예언의 말씀을 듣는 각 사람에게 증거하노니, 만일 누구든지 이것들 외에 더하면 하나님이 이 책에 기록된 재앙들을 그에게 더하실 것이요[요한계시록 22:18].</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16">이상의 구절들을 통해 우리는 하나님의 말씀을 전하는 사자의 역할과 그 중요성에 대해 깊이 이해할 수 있습니다. 하나님께서는 그분의 뜻을 전할 신실한 종들을 선택하셨고, 그들에게 자신의 말씀을 주셨습니다. 이 말씀은 더하거나 뺄 수 없는 온전한 것이며, 그대로 전해져야 합니다. 예수 그리스도께서는 이 사명을 완벽히 수행하신 궁극적인 사자이십니다.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">우리도 그분의 본을 따라 하나님의 말씀을 신실하게 전하는 삶을 살아야 할 것입니다. 이를 통해 우리는 하나님의 뜻을 더 깊이 알게 되고, 그분과의 관계가 더욱 깊어질 것입니다. 이 말씀들을 통해 여러분 모두가 은혜복음과 하나님 아는 지식에서 더욱 성장하시길 소망합니다.</p>
