<li>Visit Prometric&rsquo;s website, enter &ldquo;98092,&rdquo; and check real-time seat availability. Most centers operate Monday through Saturday, with some offering evening or Sunday hours.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>When to Take the Exam (Soonest Availability)</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Testing Window:</b> The current SEE testing window runs from May 1, 2025, to February 28, 2026. However, as of today, March 5, 2025, you&rsquo;re in the annual blackout period (March and April), during which no testing occurs. This is when the IRS updates the exam for tax law changes.</li>
<li><b>Earliest Possible Date:</b> The soonest you can take the exam is <b>May 1, 2025</b>, when the next testing window opens.</li>
<li><b>Scheduling Timeline:</b> You can schedule now for May 1, 2025, or later dates in the window. Prometric allows scheduling up to six months in advance, so act soon to secure your preferred date and location, as slots fill up quickly near the window&rsquo;s start.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Recommendation</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Action Now:</b> Apply for or renew your PTIN immediately if needed, then visit Prometric&rsquo;s site to schedule Part 1 (or your preferred part) for May 1, 2025, at a center near 98092 (e.g., Renton or Tacoma). Booking early ensures availability.</li>
<li><b>Preparation Time:</b> Use the next 8 weeks (March 5 to May 1) to study. Each part typically requires 30-50 hours of prep, so 4-6 hours per week is a solid pace if starting now.</li>
<li><b>Backup Plan:</b> If May 1 fills up, aim for early May (e.g., May 2-7) to stay on track for completing all parts within the 2025-2026 window.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Additional Tips</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li>Check Prometric&rsquo;s site frequently for cancellations that might open earlier slots.</li>
<li>Contact Prometric at 800-306-3926 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-9 p.m. ET) if you encounter issues or need to confirm local center details.</li>
<li>Since you&rsquo;re in the blackout period, this is an ideal time to prepare thoroughly for a strong start on May 1.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16">By scheduling now for May 1, 2025, you&rsquo;ll secure the soonest possible exam date from today, given the current date and testing constraints. Let me know if you need help with study resources or further details!</p>
