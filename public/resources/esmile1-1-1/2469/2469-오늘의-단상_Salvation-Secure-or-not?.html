<h3 data-ke-size="size23">Preface</h3>
<p data-ke-size="size16">As I write this book, I do so not as a scholar or theologian, nor as one formally recognized by institutions or denominations. I write simply as a brother in Christ Jesus, a fellow traveler who has tasted the goodness of God&rsquo;s Word and desires to share what I have learned through diligent study of the King James Bible.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">Throughout my journey of faith, I have come to realize how easily Scripture can be misinterpreted when not rightly divided. The complexities of God&rsquo;s Word are not given to confuse us but to encourage deeper dependence on the Holy Spirit for understanding. The goal of this work is to guide fellow believers away from the dangers of forced interpretations and into the joy and peace that comes from rightly discerning the Word of truth.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">In a world filled with spiritual anxiety, theological confusion, and worldly sorrows, my prayer is simple: that those who read this book may stand in full assurance before God, free from fear and doubt, and enjoy the righteousness, joy, and peace that are found in Christ Jesus alone.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">I pray that this work will strengthen your faith, deepen your confidence in the promises of God, and help you persevere until the day we all stand before the Lord, unashamed and fully rejoicing.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">To God be the glory.</p>
<h3 data-ke-size="size23">Dedication</h3>
<p data-ke-size="size16">To all my fellow brothers and sisters, especially Catherine, David and Alex in Christ Jesus,<br />who long to walk in the light of God&rsquo;s truth,<br />enjoying His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">And to those who seek to show the world<br />what it means to be genuine children of God,<br />marked by hope, free from fear, and steadfast in faith.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">May you always remember:<br />&ldquo;He that believeth on him shall not be confounded.&rdquo;<br />&mdash;Romans 9:33 (KJV)</p>
<h3 data-ke-size="size23">Introduction</h3>
<p data-ke-size="size16">The study of the Scriptures is both a great privilege and a solemn responsibility. The Holy Bible, particularly as preserved in the King James Version, contains words of life, truth, and eternal hope. Yet, scattered throughout its pages are verses that challenge even the most seasoned readers&mdash;passages that speak of falling away, warnings against apostasy, and solemn reminders to persevere until the end.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">For centuries, many have wrestled with these passages, sometimes forcing interpretations that result in fear, confusion, or imbalance. Others have approached them with preconceived ideas, reading into the text what they desire to find. Yet the Apostle Paul exhorts us to &ldquo;rightly divide the word of truth&rdquo; (2 Timothy 2:15 KJV), lest we stand ashamed before our Lord.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">This book is an offering to my fellow believers who, like me, long to navigate the Scriptures with humility and care. Without credentials or formal titles, I present myself only as a brother in Christ who loves His Word and seeks to see others stand confidently in the light of His promises. I do not speak from a pulpit, but from a heart that has been touched by grace.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">In the chapters ahead, we will examine both difficult and comforting passages side by side. We will compare the verses that seem to threaten spiritual shipwreck with those that anchor us in the security of Christ. My aim is not to promote any system of theology, but to allow the Word of God to speak for itself.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">I invite you to read prayerfully, to test every word against the Scriptures, and to trust in the faithfulness of the Lord who began a good work in you. May we all arrive at a clearer understanding of His truth and a deeper rest in His finished work.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">In Christ alone,<br />Your Beloved Brother in Christ Jesus</p>
