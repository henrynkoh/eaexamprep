                            <p data-ke-size="size16">let's compare Schedule A, Schedule B, and Schedule C:</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>1. Schedule A (Itemized Deductions):</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Purpose:</b> To calculate itemized deductions, which you'll use instead of the standard deduction if your itemized deductions are higher.</li>
<li><b>Who Uses It:</b> Taxpayers who have enough qualifying expenses (like medical expenses, state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions) that exceed their standard deduction amount.</li>
<li><b>Key Sections:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Medical and Dental Expenses:</b> Deductible medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).</li>
<li><b>Taxes You Paid:</b> State and local taxes (SALT), but limited to a combined total of $10,000 (this limit may change in future years).</li>
<li><b>Interest You Paid:</b> Home mortgage interest.</li>
<li><b>Gifts to Charity:</b> Deductions for charitable contributions.</li>
<li><b>Casualty and Theft Losses:</b> Losses from casualty or theft (subject to certain limitations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Impact on Form 1040:</b> The total itemized deductions from Schedule A are entered on Form 1040, line 12.</li>
<li><b>Image Relevance:</b> Form 1040, line 12 refers to Standard deduction or itemized deductions (from Schedule A).</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>2. Schedule B (Interest and Ordinary Dividends):</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Purpose:</b> To report interest income and ordinary dividends if they exceed a certain amount.</li>
<li><b>Who Uses It:</b> Taxpayers whose taxable interest income is over $1,500 from all sources, and taxpayers whose ordinary dividends are over $1,500.</li>
<li><b>Key Sections:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Part I - Interest:</b> Lists each source of taxable interest income (e.g., bank accounts, CDs, bonds) if the total is over $1,500.</li>
<li><b>Part II - Ordinary Dividends:</b> Lists each source of ordinary dividend income (e.g., stocks, mutual funds) if the total is over $1,500.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Impact on Form 1040:</b> The total taxable interest and ordinary dividends from Schedule B are entered on Form 1040, lines 2a and 3b, respectively.</li>
<li><b>Image Relevance:</b> Form 1040 lines 2a and 3b list Tax-exempt interest and Ordinary dividends.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>3. Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship)):</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Purpose:</b> To report the profit or loss from a business you operated as a sole proprietor (or single-member LLC treated as a sole proprietorship).</li>
<li><b>Who Uses It:</b> Self-employed individuals, independent contractors, freelancers, and other sole proprietors.</li>
<li><b>Key Sections:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Part I - Income:</b> Reports the gross income from your business.</li>
<li><b>Part II - Expenses:</b> Reports all the deductible expenses related to your business (e.g., advertising, rent, utilities, supplies, depreciation).</li>
<li><b>Net Profit or Loss:</b> Calculates the net profit or loss by subtracting expenses from income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Impact on Form 1040:</b> The net profit or loss from Schedule C is transferred to Schedule 1 (Form 1040) and then to Form 1040, line 8.</li>
<li><b>Image Relevance:</b> The images do not show any direct relevance to Schedule C</li>
</ul>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Impact on 1040</b></td>
<td>Reduces taxable income if itemized deductions are greater than standard deduction (Form 1040, line 12).</td>
