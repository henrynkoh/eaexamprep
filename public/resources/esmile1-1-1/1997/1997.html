<p data-ke-size="size16">This guide synthesizes the AI tools and workflow Riley Brown presents to build a "voice notes app" which includes recording, transcribing, web clipping, and potentially AI-powered chat/organization.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Phase 1: Planning &amp; Knowledge Exploration</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Define the Core Concept:</b> Clearly articulate the purpose and target audience of your voice notes app. (Apply the Meaningful Project principle).</li>
<li><b>Research Core Functionality:</b> Use Perplexity to identify the best libraries/APIs for:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li>Voice Recording in a web browser.</li>
<li>Audio Transcription (APIs and services).</li>
<li>Web Clipping/Content Extraction.</li>
<li>Chat/Organization Features (if desired).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Create a Notebook LM Workspace:</b> Set up a new Notebook LM workspace and upload relevant documentation for each of the libraries and services you've identified. This will act as your personal research hub.</li>
<li><b>Generate Podcast Overviews:</b> Use Notebook LM's "deep dive conversation" to generate AI-powered podcasts summarizing the key features and usage of those libraries/services. Listen to these to quickly grasp the core concepts.</li>
<li><b>Explore Visual Understanding:</b> Explore different forms of visuals such as chart diagrams.</li>
<li><b>Turn to Mermaid dolive</b>: Edit for the user and create a more unique way of voice recording.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Phase 2: Rapid Prototyping with Replit</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Start with a Firebase Template:</b> Initiate a new Replit project using the Firebase authentication template. This gives you a pre-built user sign-in system.</li>
<li><b>Plan Transformation:</b> "Turn the App that is currently on your screen into a link tree Competitor", which will allow you to change the way it looks.</li>
<li><b>Code Analysis:</b> Ask "Give me the breakdown of the different files in simple language", in order to maintain sign in feature.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Phase 3: Code Generation &amp; Refinement with Cursor + Voice Immersion</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Open Cursor With Voice Immersion</b>: "To open Composer, press command K on Mac or control K on Windows, then type a natural language command.".</li>
<li><b>Ask Cursor to Change Color</b>: "Change the color of the bottom buttons to Blue", and change the color of the bottoms in accordance to voice immersion.</li>
<li><b>Change the text</b>: Ask Cursor "can you please make the background of those buttons darker and then also can you please make the text bold in the thread list page that lists all the threads which also is the homepage and add some margins on on each side it should be a little bit more narrow got it to make those changes you can tell composer make the background behind the bottom", to further change the look.</li>
<li><b>Recreate look using Cursor</b>:: Ask Cursor "I would like for you to make all of the voice notes instead of them being like um separated by a line I want them to look more make it have some depth and make them cards and thick and make sure to keep all of the functionality for the voice notes I still want to be able to play them right but change the functionality so that I can um see it in like these like thick white cards within the thread Details page", and then further recreate and transform voice notes.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Phase 4: Visualizing and Structuring the APP.</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Create a visual representation:</b> create a flow chart of how you can use cursor to create an app using composer without having to write one single line of code.</li>
<li><b>Ask for diagrams</b> "Please can you create sequence diagram of all of those features and uh from the user's perspective and I want you to create a sequence diagram", in order to see a chart of it.</li>
<li><b>Edit Mermaid diagrams</b> "On Claud what you're going to do is you're just going to copy the contents the copy of the context of the CL of the code go to mermaid dolive and this is a free tool by the way and so you can just paste this in just like this and now it has all that information right here except you can actually edit it here on the side right you so you can", to enhance and make a plan for the project.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Phase 5: Creative Integration</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Enhance with <a href="http://kyber.ai/">Kyber.Ai</a>:</b> Use generated images as starting keyframes for video generation. (Implied: User can chain AI tools).</li>
<li><b>Describe Background Music:</b> In Kyber prompt "I am making a video and it's happy and a man is talking to a penguin. In six words or less describe the background music." (Implied: Integrate Kyber with other tools like Suno for a complete creative workflow).</li>
<li><b>Create Instrumental Music:</b> Create Instrumentals (Implied: Suno can generate music from short descriptions).</li>
<li>*Combine AI-Generated Content:**Add AI audio and images in Cap Cut.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Phase 6: Testing, Iteration, and Public Learning</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Test</b>: Review each of the functions and test them to make sure they work in practice.</li>
<li><b>List Types of Diagrams:</b> Ask Perplexity to list types of Mermaid diagrams.</li>
<li><b>Mermaid DOlive test</b>:: Edit for the user what sounds it is making.</li>
