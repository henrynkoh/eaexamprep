<p id="SE-355692ef-843f-4e29-84d4-dbf12660c313" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(03:54) that's the seven crowns for the believer then the tribulation saints it looks like that if they're martyred if they're slaughtered if you will for jesus they might get a crown of a martyr's crown for resisting the antichrist and the mark of the beast and then i showed you how last week you know some people like i don't like that so you might can just lump the two together because we are the body of christ we're one with christ and then you could have your other number seven which was the stars in heaven remember</span></p>
<p id="SE-a87a41b2-c9f7-4677-b43a-b7ebd693d0ae" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(04:22) revelation 12 there's some star in heaven and what is that it's a representation or it's a type or a symbol of something in the bible but laura pointed out at the end of the last weeks i don't know if you can see it online but she says but that's in the second heaven and you were talking about the third heaven so i go okay yeah so i'm not gonna do another message on seven crowns in the second heaven and then seven crowns in the first half now i can't that's too much we've gone far</span></p>
