<p data-ke-size="size16">위의 성경 구절들을 통해 우리는 성령께서 바울과 초대 교회 사도들에게 어떻게 명령하셨는지 알 수 있습니다. 성령은 그들에게 특정 지역으로 가라고 하시거나, 어떤 곳에 가지 말라고 하셨습니다. 또한 앞으로 일어날 일들에 대해 경고하시고, 선교 사역을 위해 특정인을 따로 세우라고 지시하셨습니다. 성령은 그들에게 권능을 주시고 예수님의 증인이 되게 하셨습니다. 이러한 성령의 인도하심은 오늘날에도 여전히 우리의 삶과 사역 가운데 역사하고 계십니다. 우리도 성령의 음성에 귀 기울이고 순종함으로써 하나님의 뜻을 이루어갈 수 있기를 소망합니다. 이를 통해 은혜복음과 하나님 아는 지식에서 더욱 성장하시길 소망합니다.</p>
