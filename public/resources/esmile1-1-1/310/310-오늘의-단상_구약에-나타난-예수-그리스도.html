Transcript: [Music] in this video we're going to take a look at every book of the Old Testament and find at least one prophecy about Jesus this video is by no means exhaustive but should give you a good foundation of where to start before we get started Please Subscribe like this video and don't forget to share it with anybody you think might need it all right let's jump right into it two specific prophecy in the Book of Genesis about Jesus firstly the book prophesied that the Messiah would be born of the seed of a woman take a look at Genesis 3:15 it says and I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your Offspring and hers he will crush your head and you will strike his heel referring to the serpent and of course if we look at the New Testament Luke 1: 34-35 you'll see when Mary asked the angel how will this be that she's going to give birth since she is a virgin after all in verse 35 the angel answered the holy spirit will come on you and the power of the most high will overshadow you so the Holy One to be born will be called the the Son of God now just a side note here the same word used for o overshadow is the same one used in the Old Testament where God's spirit overshadowed the Ark of the Covenant why is this important there are many reasons when we get to the Book of Exodus we'll refer back to this now the second thing or the second prophecy I want to point out is that the Messiah Jesus would be a king from the line of Judah take a look at Genesis 49 verse 10 the scepter will not depart from Judah nor the ruler staff from between his feet until he to whom it belong shall come and The Obedience of the Nations shall be his that is when the Messiah the king of Israel comes he shall be from the line of Judah take a look in the New Testament John 1:49 then Nathaniel declared Rabbi you are the Son of God you are the king of Israel now let's move on to the Book of Exodus and two prophecies about Jesus I want to point out here firstly and perhaps most importantly in Exodus 12 what was the function of the Passover Lamb the lamb that was to be sacrificed now I will be doing another video on the Passover Lamb as it will take up some time and I can't cover it in this video but take a look what John the Baptist says in the New Testament in the Book of John 1: 29 and the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said look the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world exactly the function of the Passover Lamb in the Old Testament and the second prophecy I want to point out is that Jesus would be the Mana from Heaven literally when the Israelites were stuck in the desert God fed them with Mana that fell from the skies it didn't really fall and again I'll be doing another video of what Mana really means but I want you to notice a couple things Jesus himself said I am the bread of life your forefathers ate the Mana in the wilderness and yet they died but this is the bread that comes down from heaven talking about himself so that anyone may eat of it and never die I myself am the living bread now Take a Look what Jesus says in the Book of John chapter 6 beginning in verse 31 our ancestors ate the Mana in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat Jesus said to them very truly I tell you it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world and do you remember my point in Genesis how the Holy Spirit would overshadow Mary just as it did the Ark of the Covenant well what was one of the things in the Ark of the Covenant it was Mana Jesus was in the ark or the typified Ark of the Covenant in Mary and he was the Mana moving on to the Book of Leviticus now in this book the main prophecy about Jesus is that he is the emphasis the high priest Leviticus 16 outlines the high priest's Duty on the day of atonement now without getting into detail because this does deserve its own video I'll just quickly summarize that Jesus is the high priest however the sacrifice is not the blood of gos and calves but rather his own body his own blood take a look at Hebrews 9: 11 through 14 but when Christ appeared as the high priest of the good things to come he entered through the greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this creation and not through the blood of goats and calves but through his own blood he entered the holy Place once for all having obtained Eternal Redemption moving on to the Book of Numbers there are a couple prophecies here mainly that the Messiah would become king take a look at Numbers chapter 24 and that the Messiah Jesus would be the water from the rock read Numbers Chapter 20 but my favorite is that the Messiah would be typified in the bronze serpent when the Israelites were led into the desert they complained to Moses take a look at Numbers chapter 21 and they said to Moses why have you L us here is it to Die Why did you take us s from Egypt and so the Lord sent snakes so that many of the Israelites died and what do they do they ask Moses to intercede for them and he does so the Lord God says beginning in verse 8 of chapter 21 the Lord says to Moses make a snake image and mount it on a pole when anyone who is bitten looks at it he will recover so Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole whenever someone Was Bitten and he looked at the bronze snake he he recovered that is they would live and not die what's great about this Old Testament passage is in the Old Testament when you doubted what the Lord had already promised bad things would happen but he would always provide a way out so long as you repented that is you changed your mind now take a look at what Jesus says to Nicodemus in the Book of John chapter 3 Nicodemus said to Jesus how can these things be Jesus answered him are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things truly truly I say to you we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen but you do not receive our testimony if I have told you Earthly things and you do not believe how can you believe if I tell you Heavenly things no one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from Heaven the son of man and now listen watch this in verse 14 he say says and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life notice something in the old test when you looked upon the bronze snake you would be resuscitated and then of course later you die your natural death what Jesus is saying is now when you look upon him who is lifted up the son of man you will have eternal life that is though you may die physically you shall live forever moving on to the book of Deuteronomy the main prophecy here is that the Messiah the Christ will be a prophet like Moses take a look at Deuteronomy 18: 15-19 the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me Moses from among you from your fellow Israelites you must listen to him for this is what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said let us not hear the voice of the Lord Our God this is a very popular and well-known passage among the Jews throughout the history this is one of the verses they use to say that the Messiah whom they believe is not Jesus would be Moses or a type of Moses or greater than Moses rather now take a look at John 6:14 after the people saw the sign Jesus performed what sign was that that he fed the 5,000 remember that story go back and read it starts at verse one they began to say surely this is the prophet like Moses who is to come into the world now notice how that Miracle had to do with feeding the 5,000 with bread just like when the Israelites were wandering in the desert with Moses and they were fed the bread from Heaven the Mana now moving on to the Book of Joshua Jesus is both typified and it is prophesy that he is the commander of the Lord's army take a listen here beginning in Joshua 5:13 when Joshua was near Jericho he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand Joshua approached him and asked are you for us or for our enemies neither he replied that is the man I have now come as the commander of the Lord's army that is of yahweh's army then Joshua bowed with his face to the ground in worship and asked the man what does my Lord want to say to his servant the commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua remove the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is Holy and Joshua did so now notice a couple things Joshua sees someone who's both man and Lord he's the commander of the army this is what we call a theophany an appearance of the holy God and notice also that the commander of </span></p>

He forgets for a while but then when the king is tormented by a dream he remembers Joseph. Christ in the cross also laments "Father, have you forgoten me?". To make this also more present, even the two thieves rappresent the two inmates of Joseph. Where one dies but the one accepts Jesus and is saved from.</span></p>

You mention explicit prophecy about the Seed, or Son (Christ). But Christ is woven throughout each story. For example, the apostles tell us that Adam himself was an archetype, and marriage (a "great mystery") is a thing concerning Christ and the Church. In other words, marriage is made in the image of Christ and the Beloved there in the beginning as the man was put into a "deep sleep", and the Beloved was made of him and for him. The Church is also, of Christ and for Christ, members of His body. Also, Melchizedek is the priesthood and priest appearing before the lesser were established. Christ is in the same line of Melchizedek, and being eternal, it is safe to say that Melchizedek is not a type, but a Christophany. Christ is also seen in the children given as sons of promise in the patriarchs. They are the great expectation and hope. This is especially evident in Joseph, the first and last who was predestined, betrayed, and raised up to the highest place for the salvation of many. That's just Genesis. Christ is all in all.</span></p>

Bless all who seek the truth.</span></p>

The cross for his people sins</span></p>

He was the beginning and the end. Nothing exists without Him. We are in His plan- all directly and indirectly serving the Lord God with our faithfulness or rebellion. God's plan will neither cease nor fail just because of believers or unbelievers. God saw our hearts before He formed us in thd womb. All our hairs are numbered, not even our spouse could count our hair , but God loves and cares for mankind. We must be grateful for everything because our physical needs and spiritual needs are different. Blessed be the Holy One , my Creator who put every details carefully and wonderfully while creating me. God makes no errors.</span></p>
