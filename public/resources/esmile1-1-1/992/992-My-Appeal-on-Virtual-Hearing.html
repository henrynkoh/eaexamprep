<p data-ke-size="size16">I am here today to respectfully request consideration regarding two parking tickets I received during my first visit to Hoboken. I understand and respect the traffic regulations, which is why I promptly paid the fine for the first ticket, acknowledging my initial mistake.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">After settling the first ticket, I sought local advice to avoid further issues. A Hoboken resident informed me that parking in a commercial area would be permissible until 9:00 AM. Acting on this guidance, I parked my rented vehicle at midnight and moved it before 9:00 AM, at approximately 8:50 AM. Unfortunately, I discovered another ticket issued to my vehicle shortly after relocating it.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">I am appealing for leniency on the second ticket under the grounds that as a visitor, I relied on local advice and acted in good faith to comply with what I understood to be allowable. Given that this confusion arose from my efforts to adhere to local parking norms, I kindly request that the court consider my situation and the prompt payment of my first ticket as a demonstration of my respect for the city's regulations.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">Thank you for considering my appeal.</p>
