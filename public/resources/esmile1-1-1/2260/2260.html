                            <p data-ke-size="size16">To classify the <b>Special Enrollment Examination (SEE)</b> questions and official answers according to main topics and subtopics, I&rsquo;ll rely on the structure of the SEE as outlined by the IRS and Prometric, which administers the exam. The SEE is divided into three parts: <b>Part 1: Individuals</b>, <b>Part 2: Businesses</b>, and <b>Part 3: Representation, Practices, and Procedures</b>. Each part contains specific topics and subtopics that reflect the knowledge required to become an Enrolled Agent (EA). Since I don&rsquo;t have access to the exact sample questions from the IRS for 2025, I&rsquo;ll base this classification on the official test specifications, historical data from prior years, and general knowledge about the exam&rsquo;s structure.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">The percentages provided (e.g., ~?%) are approximate estimates based on the typical distribution of questions across topics and subtopics as derived from the IRS SEE Candidate Information Bulletin, Prometric&rsquo;s topic outlines, and preparatory resources like iPREP and Bova Books. These percentages reflect the relative emphasis of each topic and subtopic within each part, with each part consisting of 100 questions (85 scored, 15 experimental). The total exam has 300 questions, and I&rsquo;ll distribute the weight accordingly.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">Below is a table classifying the main topics and subtopics for the SEE, along with approximate percentages and examples of where prospective questions might belong.</p>
