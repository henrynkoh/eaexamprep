<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>1. Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return):</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Purpose:</b> This is the main form you use to file your federal income taxes. It's a summary of your income, deductions, and credits, ultimately determining your tax liability (how much you owe or your refund amount).</li>
<li><b>Key Sections:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Income:</b> Reports your wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and other sources of income. It also includes a line for "Additional Income" from Schedule 1.</li>
<li><b>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):</b> Your gross income minus certain deductions (often called "above-the-line" deductions).</li>
<li><b>Deductions:</b> You choose between the standard deduction or itemizing deductions (using Schedule A).</li>
<li><b>Taxable Income:</b> Your AGI minus your deductions. This is the income your tax is based on.</li>
<li><b>Tax Liability:</b> The amount of tax you owe based on your taxable income.</li>
<li><b>Credits:</b> Credits directly reduce your tax liability.</li>
<li><b>Payments:</b> Reports taxes you've already paid (through withholding or estimated taxes).</li>
<li><b>Refund or Amount Owed:</b> The final calculation of whether you're getting a refund or owe additional taxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Think of it as:</b> The cover sheet for all your tax information. It pulls information from other forms and schedules to arrive at your final tax outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>2. Schedule 1 (Additional Income and Adjustments to Income):</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Purpose:</b> This form is used to report types of income or adjustments to income that don't have a specific line on Form 1040 itself. It's attached to Form 1040.</li>
<li><b>Key Sections:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Part I: Additional Income:</b> Includes income like unemployment compensation, alimony, business income (if you're not filing a separate Schedule C), capital gains, and other miscellaneous income.</li>
<li><b>Part II: Adjustments to Income:</b> Includes deductions like IRA contributions, student loan interest, self-employment tax, and other deductions that reduce your gross income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Think of it as:</b> A detailed list of specific income and deduction items that ultimately impact your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) on Form 1040.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>3. Schedule A (Itemized Deductions):</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Purpose:</b> This form is used to list itemized deductions. You would use this form if the total of your itemized deductions is greater than your standard deduction amount. It's attached to Form 1040.</li>
<li><b>Key Sections:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Medical and Dental Expenses:</b> Deductible medical expenses exceeding a certain percentage of your AGI.</li>
<li><b>Taxes You Paid:</b> State and local taxes (SALT), limited to a certain amount.</li>
<li><b>Interest You Paid:</b> Home mortgage interest.</li>
<li><b>Gifts to Charity:</b> Deductions for charitable contributions.</li>
<li><b>Casualty and Theft Losses:</b> Losses from casualty or theft (subject to certain limitations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Think of it as:</b> A detailed list of personal expenses that the IRS allows you to deduct from your AGI, if those itemized deductions are more advantageous than taking the standard deduction.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Here's a table summarizing the key differences:</b></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">Feature Form 1040 Schedule 1 Schedule A</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>In essence:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li>You always file Form 1040.</li>
<li>You file Schedule 1 if you have specific types of income or adjustments to income that aren't directly on Form 1040.</li>
<li>You file Schedule A only if your itemized deductions are greater than your standard deduction.</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16">I hope this comparison clarifies the purpose and relationship of these three forms!</p>
