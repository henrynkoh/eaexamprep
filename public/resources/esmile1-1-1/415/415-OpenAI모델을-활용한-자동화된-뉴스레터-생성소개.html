<p id="SE-c7fd7ddf-f326-4b00-ad47-fb8c7d541e05" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(00:29) of the work here to kind of explain how I wanted to set this up so you can see here I have four different agents and we have this Mastermind that is going to be run by open ai1 preview that is kind of the latest biggest model right so the first agent is going to be the web agent so this is responsible for getting on the web collecting the information we want right and it's going to report back to the Mastermind when it has uh fetch the information it need and The Mastermind is going to evaluate is this good enough to proceed with if yes we</span></p>
<p id="SE-da592fd5-7791-4e6f-aac0-342fa45b1d84" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(01:08) move on if not it's going to send a message back uh this was not good enough do something else right that is basically the idea but let's say this was good enough now then we can kind of move on to our second agent and that is going to be kind of the writer that is going to rewrite uh the kind of unstructured data we collected from the webite into uh yeah more structured format and here it usually goes a bit back and forward right because usually the 01 model here wants to do some changes it want to Yeah clean up and yeah you will</span></p>
<p id="SE-8ab3d96c-2117-4a14-82dd-072ee1e9dc76" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(01:45) see what kind of suggestions it has to improve this and when this is approved uh we actually going to move over to the voice agent so this has the responsibility of taking this yeah the short stories here we're going to write the new stories and turn them into a script that fits well to turn into a voice version of this that we are going to generate this has almost no uh this sends the signal let's go do this but I haven't really seen it try to correct this maybe one time I saw it made some suggestions to improve it but usually</span></p>
<p id="SE-e79406ee-bf53-4a5a-979f-4e02eac86270" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(02:26) this works pretty well by using GT4 or mini I haven't seen any big issues here and the final agent we have is the newsletter agent so this is the final form so this is the news Le agent uh this agent is responsible for actually taking uh the stories we have and turning them into an HTML template that we can send as a newsletter uh as you will see pretty soon and this also uh when our big Mastermind o1 model sends this instructions to this agent we usually go a bit back and forward because it usually wants to change a few</span></p>
<p id="SE-fa1b3eb9-1e71-4479-b755-c126d63550c8" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(03:06) things uh but when the 01 Mastermind is happy with the final form here uh we have one more thing and this is kind of set in the middle here right so then we are going to actually send the newslet oops you're going to send the newsletter out to our mailing list right that we kind of that is our subscriptions and for this we have some kind of API that we're going to use you can say that this is Agent five but it's basically a simple script that gets called by The Mastermind and we get like a confirmation that this is sent to our</span></p>

<p id="SE-bf1d18ea-e086-4163-b8c9-bb0c56f4d849" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(04:17) very happy with this and I think it's pretty cool to see these kind of results uh but I think we just going to take a look at the code now uh to kind of show you how I set this up and then we're going to do a few tests see what we can bring back and yeah let's just head over to cursor and take a look at our code here okay so let's start by just looking at the individual agents we have here right so I think we're just going to start with the web agent this has a very specific job uh yeah this is a bit Shady</span></p>
<p id="SE-4b519aa7-0c85-4aa7-b9f7-8192112200db" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(04:49) but what I wanted to do is to create a tech newsletter and for this we are have to do some scraping so I kind of picked one of the biggest sites I know so we don't yeah so it's going to be the Verge and for this I have set up some X pads here that is kind of very uh targeted uh I could show you what these xats point to just just give me a sec so if you go to the Birch homepage they have this thing called most popular and this is what it points to but uh yeah you could pretty much change this to anything you</span></p>
<p id="SE-c3fedf3d-0eea-479d-8923-3c9c3b6cd668" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(05:25) wanted to right it could be your homepage it could be Google that is basically up to you but in this case uh for my test I pointed to this most popular section here on the verge just for my test cases uh so that is basically how the first uh code works so we can just run it without going into too much detail uh I will put all of this full project up on my uh Community GitHub so if you want to try this out set this up for yourself just become a member of the channel and you will get access to this and you can play around</span></p>
<p id="SE-0da4ebb9-b054-4239-b16b-b74eabe1ef8d" data-ke-size="size16"><span style="color: #000000;">(05:58) with it so let's just run the the web agent now so we can do this one by one so yeah you can see this is going out and collecting some information for us right so we got this uh text file here called content and this is kind of the unstructured data we got so it's 800 something lines here with uh it is the stories from the links but it's pretty much unstructured so it's not so usable right and that is kind of where the um the second agent comes into play and that is the rewrite agent here you can</span></p>
