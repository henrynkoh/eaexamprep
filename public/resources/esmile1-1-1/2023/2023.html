<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>30-Step Guide: Mastering Cursor AI Rules</b></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">This guide takes the concepts from the transcript and presents them in a structured, actionable way. It focuses on how to use the tool and apply the principles.</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>I. Preparation and Project Setup</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Define Global Rules Philosophy:</b> Before starting, consider what general coding practices you want applied to every project (e.g., commit message formatting, preferred libraries).</li>
<li><b>Download and Install Cursor:</b> Acquire Cursor from <a href="https://cursor.sh/">cursor.sh</a>.</li>
<li><b>Create a Project Folder:</b> Establish a dedicated folder for your new project.</li>
<li><b>Open Project Folder in Cursor:</b> Use "File -&gt; Open" to open the folder. This is crucial for Cursor to establish the correct context.</li>
<li><b>Initialize Next.js Project:</b> If starting from scratch, use Cursor's AI to initialize a Next.js project within the folder.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>(Prompt - Example):</b> "I want to install nextjs in this directory"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Add Basic Dependencies (if desired):</b> Use Cursor's AI to install libraries like Shadcn UI, Lucid React Icons, and Sonar Toast.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>(Prompt - Example):</b> "I want to install Shadcn UI, Lucid React Icons, and Sonar Toast"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>II. Rule Creation and Implementation</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Create .cursor/rules Folder:</b> Create a folder named .cursor/rules at the root of your project.</li>
<li><b>Create Rule Files:</b> Inside .cursor/rules, create files (e.g., shadcn-install.md, commit-message.md).</li>
<li><b>Define Rule Purpose:</b> In each rule file, clearly state the purpose of the rule (e.g., "Always use MPX shadcn-ui@latest init to initialize Shadcn").</li>
<li><b>Specify Triggers (Globs):</b> (Optional) Use glob patterns to restrict the rule's application to specific file types or directories (e.g., src/**/*.tsx). Be aware of potential issues and consult Cursor documentation.</li>
<li><b>Add Examples (Crucial):</b> Include clear examples of how the rule should be applied. This helps the AI understand your intent.</li>
<li><b>Craft the Rule Content:</b> Provide the precise instructions or code snippets that the AI should use.</li>
<li><b>Use Prompt Engineering (for specific use cases):</b> For example: set the main hero on the landing page in the background, and then adjust the speed.</li>
<li><b>Test the Rules</b>: Try to do and create certain key aspects, and see that the rules trigger and follow them.</li>
<li><b>Be proactive:</b> Don't get discouraged if it doesn't work on the first try.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>III. Rule Activation and Project Workflow</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Resync Codebase Index:</b> Go to "Features -&gt; Codebase Indexing" in Cursor and click "Resync". This ensures that Cursor recognizes the new rule files.</li>
<li><b>Verify Rule Activation:</b> After resyncing, confirm that Cursor is recognizing your new rules.</li>
<li><b>Engage Composer:</b> Use Cursor's Composer to generate code or modify existing code, triggering the rules.</li>
<li><b>Observe Rule Application:</b> Pay attention to whether the rules are being applied correctly.</li>
<li><b>Iterative Debugging:</b> If a rule isn't working as expected, carefully review the rule file, the glob pattern (if any), and the prompt you're using. Resync the codebase index and try again.</li>
<li><b>Testing different rules:</b> There is nothing better then trying one rule and another, to better fit the use case.</li>
<li><b>Testing different cases:</b> there is nothing that works better then cases! The more and more cases to see if the test will work as desired!</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>IV. Advanced Strategies and Refinement</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Leverage Component Libraries:</b> Use libraries like Shadcn UI and Lucid React Icons to accelerate UI development.</li>
<li><b>Explore Code Generation Tools:</b> Consider using tools like Copy Coder (though paid) to quickly generate initial project scaffolding from website screenshots.</li>
<li><b>Prioritize Code Quality:</b> Focus on writing clear, concise prompts that guide the AI to produce well-structured and maintainable code.</li>
<li><b>Learn From the Community:</b> Actively seek out and share rules with the Cursor AI community.</li>
<li><b>Using AI on a small portion of code:</b> Don't have all of your changes to run at once, as it can lead to disastrous change, but use a small sample that is needed.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>V. Version Control and Maintenance</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>Commit Frequently:</b> As the presenter emphasizes, commit your code changes constantly to a version control system (like Git). This allows you to easily revert to previous states if something goes wrong.</li>
<li><b>Document Your Rules:</b> Add comments to your rule files to explain their purpose and usage. This makes it easier to understand and maintain them in the future.</li>
<li><b>Revisit Rule and Change:</b> As you develop different aspects, it may be necessary to return to the rules and adapt/change them to better assist what you are trying to accomplish.</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Key Prompts &amp; Instructions Summary:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>(To User - Thinking about the project):</b> Before starting, consider what general coding practices you want applied to every project and create a mind map.</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - Initial Project Setup):</b> I want to install nextjs in this directory"</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - Tailwind CSS Setup):</b> We should always use MPX install Shaden",</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - The coding commands):</b> get add everything"</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - The coding comments):</b> Don't forget to commit and give me a commit command as well and then always prefix commit messages in the following way no exceptions"</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - install additional packages):</b> Install Lucid react icons and sonor toast",</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Essential Takeaways for Superior Results:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Strategic Tool Selection:</b> Choosing the right tools (Cursor, Next.js, Tailwind) significantly impacts the effectiveness of AI-assisted development.</li>
<li><b>Structured Workflow:</b> The presenter's emphasis on opening the project folder in Cursor to ensure proper environment setup</li>
<li><b>Remember to Test!</b></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-ke-size="size26"><b>&lt; Prompts &gt;</b></h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" data-ke-list-type="decimal">
<li><b>(To User - Implied: Establish Global Rules):</b> (Implied: User should think about what general rules they want across projects, before setting up the new project)</li>
<li><b>(To User - Implied: Before Starting Rules/Coding):</b> "Make sure to file and open in the right folder that's really critical"</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - Install Next.js):</b> "I want to install nextjs in this directory"</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - Install Shadcn UI):</b> "We should always use MPX install Shaden",</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - The coding commands):</b> "get add everything"</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - the coding comments):</b> "Don't forget to commit and give me a commit command as well and then always prefix commit messages in the following way no exceptions"</li>
<li><b>(To Cursor Agent - install additional packages):</b> Install Lucid react icons and sonor toast",</li>
</ol>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Verification:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li>Yes, I have now provided all of the distinct prompts, both explicit and directly implied, that are used to direct the AI (Cursor Agent).</li>
</ul>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><b>Crucial Clarifications:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" data-ke-list-type="disc">
<li><b>Focus on AI Interaction:</b> My analysis is strictly limited to identifying instructions given to the AI. I have excluded general advice, descriptions of what the user is doing, or commentary about the AI's behavior (unless it directly translates into a prompting action).a</li>
<li><b>Implied Prompts:</b> The implied prompts are, by definition, inferred from the context. I have tried to limit these to cases where the speaker's intent is unambiguously to direct the AI.</li>
<li>Redundancy is avoided</li>
