right very good uh welcome everyone and thanks for joining us today my name is Tom Wadsworth uh pleased to be your guest speaker today at your Gathering and I hope that this information is helpful to you I hope that's uh maybe perhaps enough of an introduction um been a Christian for 50 years um uh spent several years in seminary my first three years in seminary were back in the 70s then I spent another six years in seminary just in the last 10 years and I finished with a PhD in New Testament largely on this very topic so (00:42) so let's talk about the topic um why the early church didn't have worship Services I know that sounds strange to uh virtually anybody because virtually every church that I've ever heard of or been to has work ship services so the very idea that the early church didn't have them what does that mean well that's where my doctoral dissertation went and that's where I hope to take you today to explain why that is uh the case in my case the story goes ba ck to October 30th of 1977 uh I was preaching in my first year (01:24) as a full-time minister at a church in Flint Michigan I was preaching through First Corinthians and I came to 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and uh I don't know if you remember what church environment was like in the late 70s but speaking in tongues was a highly controversial topic and if you were even to talk about it it was very dangerous and potentially divisive and I was tempted to skip over 1 Corinthians 14 because it talks ex tensively about speaking in tongues but I thought there must be something of value in this (02:01) chapter so I did a deep dive into the chapter reading through it in Greek to try to figure out what is there for our our people to learn from today and I was surprised when reading this chapter that talks extensively about what Christians do when they get together that the word worship was never applied to what Christians did in their assemblies that was radically different for me I mean in our exp erience our worship talk we talk about hours of worship houses of worship we open and close our meetings with worship or open (02:38) close our worship with a with a prayer or in some sort of way we ask people where do you worship where did you worship last week we have an order of worship we have worship teams worship leaders worship pastors sometimes of course worship Services we talk about acts of worship we talk about acceptable worship as if this is something that applies to what we do and we gather together that's our language but I was surprised in doing a deep dive into the New Testament on this topic that all of this language is not New Testament Christian (03:17) language that alone is mind-boggling and I thought there must be some reason for this uh but there isn't or there is several reasons for this and that's where where my study has gone for the last 50 years I think my screen has just duplicated itself there automatically but let's uh proceed onward what that this ultim ately LED for me to do in the year 2016 I went to uh to Seminary again to go back and get a PhD on this very topic and my PhD dissertation was approved and and uh pished in 2022 just two years ago and it (03:59) was titled a worship service or an assembly an investigation of the terminology used to describe Church meetings in the New Testament uh and so I did a very very deep dive into this topic to figure out what's going on in the New Testament so that they're not describing their assemblies a s worship and ultimately my presentation comes down to two undeniable facts and not opinions and not guesses they're actually facts number one is that the New Testament does not use Greek worship terminology to refer to the Christian Assembly or to (04:41) its activities let that soak in for just a minute now here's undeniable number two wait before I go to undeniable two I've come to refer to this first fact as the worship anomaly this strange odd situation where the New Testament does not call uh Christian Gatherings as worship Services that's the anomaly uh so keep that in mind as we go on I'll refer to that again but then undeniable fact number two is this Paul expressly directed when you come together let all things be done for edification now those two corn (05:30) Stone facts is where everything else goes from here and I can almost let you go where you want to but based on these two undeniable biblical facts what are we to conclude about what we're supposed to be doing when we g athered together uh as Christians on a weekly or regular basis no matter what it is but this this command by Paul in 1 Corinthians 14 ver 26 is talking specifically about when you come together and then his language there is in command form let all things not some things not a couple things that (06:11) you like but all things be done for edification for the building up of one another in the assembly so those are the two undeniable facts keep those in mind for the next hour as we proceed through uh my research on this topic but as we go on there's a couple of cautions I need to add as I've been teaching on this topic for 50 years I uh for almost 50 years I uh have learned that there's some barriers to understanding going on here and the key barrier for all of us in understanding these simple plain New Testament truths (06:52) is a anachronism is the first one anachronism is the enemy of understanding first century assemblies now what's anachronism it's not a word that we use very often but in terms of biblical study anachronism should be uh ve very much in front of mine as a problem and what it means is it's a it's a problem in time you see the word Kronos or Chronicle in the middle of that word anachronism it's when like we presume for example that there are McDonald's restaurants on every street corner in uh (07:30) in Jerusalem in the first century this is a mistake in time where we take future or today's terminology or today's Concepts and assume that they are there in an other culture at another time anachronism particularly is a problem when dealing with the issue of church meetings because we all have our church meetings and we've all come to accept them as normative and as in our mind they right why are they right well because that's the way we do them therefore they must be right and so we just assume that it's the the right way (08:05) to do things but anachronism is the enemy of understanding first century Christian assemblies uh da Carson a well-known New we talk about what they did when they gathered together in the first century think of this image of just people hanging around some sitting some standing moms and dads brothers and sisters and kids just gathered around there's no holy Furniture here there's no big crosses on the wall or stained glass windows or spires on top of the building it's it's just folks and they're they're building up one another so if if you picture this in your mind as what's going on in the first century (10:40) when ad and used That Word Worship to designate the subject of (12:32) the investigation which was what Christians did when they gathered together in the first century but uh but the New Testament doesn't allow us to do that but he did it anyway and as it turns out virtually every single New Testament scholar who studied this topic does the exact same thing they use the term worship to apply to what they're doing in the assembly a few years later Edward schwitzer who I think was a a Dutch reformed sc oing on here with regard to the New Testament and its approach to Christian meetings and the word worship those two don't mix and Marshall was dead on right by the way in this and uh he he had been the editor of Evangelical quarterly for 25 years a (15:11) highly respected New Testament scholar that people didn't know what to do with this article and still to this day do not he continues with this statement in that article he says it's my thesis that this use of worship language incorporates a f to Christian meetings and what I have attributed that to was it's in late in the late 1990s when this these wor ship Wars got going when praise and worship music was all the rage and praise and worship bands got to be all the rage when praise and worship worship music got to be a billion dooll industry and so worship language was just flooding the Christian culture (17:50) particularly Christian uh Conservative Christian Evangelical Christian culture with worship language so that they no longer ajor methological law think of that Scholars having a major methodological flaw that's not something they're used to being guil of but they did they were and their flaw was this they were using modern categories of Christian worship and then trying to trace them back to the earliest layers of the Christian experience uh he's recognizing there is a flaw and let me just quickly run through some of those books of the last 70 so or so years here's Worship in the (20:19) New Testament by Gart G delli Robert Weber was a major writer back in the late 90s on (22:05) this wrote prolifically on the topic of worship but again a methodological flaw assuming that what Christians are doing when they're gathering together should be called worship Elmer towns in 1997 talking about worship Wars again everybody thinks when you talk about worship Wars well you're talking about the assembly so therefore the first century assemblies would have been called worship not true another flaw uh Larry herado who's ll where I've come to on this particular issue is it doesn't make a difference how you define the English word worship the real question is how do you define the Greek words that are train translated worship because when (24:31) the New Testament came out in Greek nobody was using the English word worship to describe things they were using Greek terms so our challenge becomes what do these Greek words mean and do they actually mean this English word worship and as it turns out to cut to the quic 265 of them to try to figure out what the word means and if you quickly come to a summary you study these 265 occurrences they give no indication that the word prano canotes singing doesn't connote praying or preaching or reading scripture or liturgy it it never does and you study the 265 I don't care who studies them you're going to come away saying it (27:05) doesn't refer to any of that it doesn't rather PR Cano in the old and the New Testament refers to a greeting a form of greeting whether 've probably heard of Greek lexicons and I have on my shelf back here I don't know at least five or six Greek lexicons some are uh 10 volumes long and some are just one big volume but generally what they'll say prano means one of two things they'll say prano means to bow down to prostrate yourself they all admit that but they'll also say that sometimes the word pran should be translated as worship my study led me to the conclusion that (29:49) number two is not an option it never means the Engli he Feast of Boos (31:47) these three primary feasts should bring all Jews Jewish males uh to Jerusalem to the temple and that's when they appear before the Lord they to present themselves before the Lord and there's only one way to do that it's prostration it's proano the verse goes on though and says and they shall not appear before the Lord empty-handed which is of reference to the fact they're supposed to bring an offering or a sacrifice when they come to the temple so when you hear the idea cator he will prostrate to God and declare that God is really among you now none of the English translations say he will prostrate to (34:21) God they'll all say he will worship God now what what we think when we see That Word Worship oh he's raising his hands he's praising God he's doing something like this proo never means that never in all those 265 occurrences and yet this is what the English translations somehow feel comfortable in saying but no he falls prostration indicator number one on e the deity resided and that's where you bow down now that was the first century concept of Jews and pagans pagans would go to a pagan Temple to prostrate before their God but Christians didn't have sacred buildings where the deity lived (36:58) God is now with us remember what Emmanuel means in in Matthew 1:23 Thou shalt call his name Emanuel which means god with us and he is now in US Christ in you the hope of glory God lives with us through the Holy Spirit Holiness is not out there in some bu one uh we don't even think about that I think we need to get used to that idea if you want to know what you're supposed to do when you appear before the Throne of God get down on your face that's a Biblical idea furthermore there's a second word here that's used on uh as translated to Worship in the New Testament frano is one of them which means to prostrate (39:22) yourself and the second word is this one lrua which is the verb form or lraa which is the uh the noun form what does this word mea something I found on the internet where you're burning a sacrifice on the altar uh to God this is literal lraa offering of a sacrifice but in the New Testament six times latrea is used in a metaphorical sense where we're not offering animal sacrifices of course that's actually almost a heretical idea because Jesus is the sacrifice the ultimate sacrifice the once for all sacrifice but Paul does say like in Romans chap 12 and verse one therefore I urge you Brethren by the mercies of God (41:56) to of Jesus made Temple activities Obsolete and who was it that predicted (43:58) that the temple would be utterly destroyed not one stone left upon another you're right it was Jesus in Mark chapter 13 Matthew 24 the entire chapter a lengthy discussion about the destruction of Jerusalem coming from the the mouth of Jesus at that time uh Christians yes they praised God and they prayed in their assemblies but these activities were not viewed as prano or as l truo in the New Testament that's helps to tion uh focused on 15 passages throughout the New Testament that are the primary passages that teach content about what should be taking place in a Christian meeting let's s summarize my findings (46:19) here without going through all the details the assembly is never described as worship it's not described as a service and certainly not described as a worship service that's one good finding you can find by looking through all the evidence secondly it is described as a gathering the Greek word s resence of one another so all of us are joining our voices together to God in when we are praying singing together we're singing to one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs they have a horizontal effect of building up one another when we do that activity the same thing is true with the Lord's Supper as well (48:44) which is a communal activity where we're all involved in taking the bread and the the the wine together uh uh as a group as a body of Christ because the bread represents th idea that yeah everything's supposed to be done to build up one another well then how come all churches today have worship services and have hours of worship and they have worship buildings and they have all this worship stuff how did that language developed was it in the 20th century was it in the 15th when was it well here I did did and did a deep dive this also took me many months to do I went into second century Christian (51:21) literature third century Christian literature and there's a ma 3:18) Temple to Athena he makes this statement while speaking to the Athenian Gentiles he says The God Who made the world and everything in it does not dwell in temples made by hands nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything again very early on in the earliest understanding of what the core of the Gospel is both Stephen and Paul understand the temples are no more they're gone God doesn't dwell there anymore he's not served by human hands which all those people did this this Ar he teacher of Asia the father of the Christians the destroyer of our Gods who (55:41) teaches many not to sacrifice or worship now when he says worship there it's the Greek word prano there as you see there on your screen or to sacrifice that's the Greek word thuan which is a a synonym to l in so this early Christian Bishop is known for telling people not to worship what he mean though meant though by not to bow down not to go to Temples not to sacrifice Christianity was understood to be radical vancing up to the year 300 ad Arius and another Christian father he says in his writing against the Heathen he says we do not build temples for the ceremonies of (58:15) worship do we we do not set up statues and images of any God we don't build altars this was their understanding even as late as 300 a now why did Christians oppose this and how did Christians get to using worship terminology in reference to uh their meetings as I did a deeper dive into this I started to notice a shift taking pla now if you're going to do that then the table upon which it sits becomes an altar you follow that because all sacrifices in the first century and the second century or offered on an altar whether it's a pagan temple with a pagan altar or the Jewish temple and a Jewish (1:01:03) altar it's an altar of sacrifice so if you're going to have a sacrifice you're going to have an altar and then if you're going to have an altar and a sacrifice the person who presides over that becomes a priest and this w you may have heard of uus the church father and the church historian writing around 32025 ad uh he's writing about the history of Christianity he records of of a sermon that is preached at the building of a new building uh after Constantine around 320 ad and he refers to that building as a holy Temple of God see already how far the Christians had shifted from plain old house meetings people gathered together in (1:03:40) horizontal one anothering taking place in those meetings and by then if you sses my best guess of what we ought to be doing now and maybe you would come up with different guesses at to what we should be doing now well you figure it out but what do we do now well first first I think we need to adopt biblical terminology to what we're doing um let's call our assemblies assemblies let's call them Gatherings let's not call it a service because that implies something wrong about what we're doing let's not call it worship because it's also grossly mistaken it leads us (1:05:5 d them up um it needs to be the expressed purpose of a need on the signs above the room as (1:07:34) you go into the building whatever it is uh uh if you're can to have a signboard outside a special building this is a house of edification how about that a house of worship tends to lead in an inappropriate Direction the third thing I think we ought to do is is break big groups into small groups I really don't know how if you've got a group of a thousand people meeting in a room how are you suppos a fundamental misunderstanding of what ought to be at the center of Christian meetings and that it leads to a serious shift in practice from what to be happening when we gathered together now that's not me saying that that's Howard (1:10:00) Marshall one of the the elite New Testament Scholars of his day he died a few years ago still highly regarded among Evangelical Christians at that time I think he was right then nobody was listening then but maybe they'll listen now so I come back to these spent the last 50 years worshiping God every week um so that's my best guess of why the early church didn't have worship Services I do have seven videos there at my website at Tom Wadsworth domcom it's also at my YouTube page look up uh YouTube at Tom Wadsworth and you'll see them there and you can see all seven videos and what you got (1:12:26) today was all seven videos in one really long presentation"</span></p>

After over 50 years of going to church through out my life (many denominations, presbyterians, baptists, and non-denominations, both big and small.), I came to the same conclusion after studying the Bible, and feeling uneasy with modern church. It felt like no one else understood me, but now I'm so happy that I'm not alone. Pastors have become priests, acting as intermediaries, like in the old testament, like when they need to bless the offerings and tithes like a sacrifice on the altar, wearing religious outfit. In the Bible, I believe that communion was having fellowship and sharing meals with fellow believers, not eating tiny piece of dried bread and drinking an ounce of grape juice as a ritual. I'm not anti-church. I am still a member of local presbyterian church and I try to serve. I just wanted true fellowship and meaningful worship, not some religious ceremonies week in and week out.</span></p>

I thought the "rediscovery of worship" was an unhealthy development, so I preached an entire series entitled "The Reason for Our Gathering. I argued that worship is not a prominent New Testament theme and that the purpose of our gathering was not worship but edification. I was a voice crying in the wilderness, and my tiny finger was not able to plug the leak in the dike of subjective emotionalism that began to flood the evangelical church. The tide of churches providing an exciting experience was irresistible, but the waters were not deep, and neither were those swept away by it. Listening to this was refreshing, though it will change nothing. However, I have often thought that the most appropriate song to be sung in a modern "worship service would be B.J. Thomas' "I'm Hooked on a Feeling."</span></p>

But when I studied the NT carefully, I came to the conclusion that what I was doing was not right. During COVID we dismantled the 'church structure'. Now it's a house church and I no longer 'pastor'. The body of Christ is edified on a regular basis. But I assume the role of building the leadership of this church. What you have said gives me the clear biblical handle to boldly pursue this idea of biblical church. Thank you!</span></p>

And I early on learned that there were no 'churches' in the NT. There were small groups of believers who met in houses. And there were no denominations in the NT.</span></p>

I've been burdened over this topic for 25 years and have researched and written on the subject. In my humble opinion, after watching this and your 7 extended videos, this is the most comprehensive work on the subject to date. Please consider tweaking your dissertation into a short book for an average person to read easily. Additionally, we have been gathering together in this way for the last 5 years, and I'm even more convinced that it is a more faithful representation of biblical assembly. The main problem is that the concept is a huge paradigm shift. Even those who understand 1 Cor 14:26 have a difficult time going against current practices. Godspeed!</span></p>

You don't need to know greek to find these. Also, heaven is filled with continuous praise and worship ALL THE TIME, and Jesus' prayer states: Thy will be done here on earth as it is in heaven. I like this one better. Matthew 6:5 "Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues[a] and on street corners so that people can see them. Truly I say to you, they have their reward! 6 But whenever you pray, go into your inner room,[b] close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you" Basically, keep it to yourself and stop disturbing others with it.</span></p>

For Catholics, worship is sacred and sacramental. Not music. When the Charismatic Renewal was introduced to the Catholic community, the typical format was adapted from Evangelical Charismatic church groups from where the charismatic renewal was first introduced to Anglicans first (Fr. Richard Bennett) and later Catholic Fr. Michael Scanlan. The format was balanced and included praise, teaching, contemporary music, tongues, Bible sharing, witness, prayer for healing. It was all new to us. We borrowed the Protestant format. For a Catholic, the Mass or divine liturgy, presided over by a priest and includes Communion, is what is meant by worship. It was not until I attended Vineyard type prayer meetings some years later that I experienced extended periods of contemporary music that included solo singing, casual instruments, did I realize for Protestant charismatics referred to music and singing as "worship." It was an odd use for a term and overly casual, unpredictable, excessive in length and focus on "celebrity" performers, was intended as "worship." It was a misnomer. It's music, and excessive, a concert, entertainment. Often, a lazy substitute for quality teaching pr preaching.</span></p>

Worship in Spirit and Truth always involves sacrifice. There&rsquo;s a reason after the Roman Persecution that God allowed the fulfillment of public worship by a sacrifice, an altar, a priest, inside a tent, house or modern tabernacle called a church. Within it, (1 Cor 14:26-33, Hebrews 13:7, 15, and Ephesians 5:19-20) say what to do in our assembly gathering in church.</span></p>

For many years my wife and I had a sense that things weren't as they should be re churches. Occasionally I'd vent to her that we arrive, shake hands, sing listen to a Greek-style orator, shake hands again and at best get into a very brief surface conversation or 2. Then that's it for another week. I found my devotion material and Bible reading far more edifying. Something is missing. I brushed off church sponsored sports and games nights. I was told that's "fellowship" that I'm missing. No, that's not fellowship, that's not edifying one another. What we came to realize is the entire modern church structure is fabricated from a business model from the 1800s. Nothing like the early church. For now we've found a small church group, and it's refreshing to find a few there we can actually discuss the Lord and our walk with Him at each gathering. Rather than discuss work and the latest shopping sales. Even take time to pray for a need or challenge. Back in the 90s, someone encouraged me to get my hands on the Whitfield Books(by Arnold Dallimore ) and other writings. I remember reading that early in Whitfield's era in England, church "societies" had been formed. Small church groups that met in meeting rooms. And when those believers crossed paths in the streets etc, it was common practice to greet one another with "do I find thee praying ?" Is there a need. There are no home churches in my area but I do see that as being the way to go. And getting back to the proper way to gather and edify.</span></p>

I was recently kicked out of a small church after 5 years because I was trying to stress the importance of lifting each other up rather than abiding by the usual time-constrained worship service to sermon schedule. For a few years, the pastor was delighted by my observations and input until recently, where he's now battling depression. I think it's no coincidence that during this time he tried to pull the entire service back to a "traditional Western service"... and I can see it that he's battling something spiritual and not physical. Thank you for this video, Tom! I've always felt a sense of freedom from all these "traditions" because of the work of Christ but didn't know how to explain it intellectually as you have done here.</span></p>

In fact, the word church didn't exist in the First Century. Rather, Jesus says "on this rock I will build my assembly. . ." And this is always what the First Century followers of Jesus called it, "the assembly". The "assembly" does not refer to a building or a religious organization but rather, a gathering together of people.</span></p>

Exodus 25:8 Let them make me a sanctuary (sacred place) that I may dwell among them.

( i said this a long time ago- I am German) The 'Worship service ' of today is very convenient to the carnal instinct / behavior of man. We do our thing and we are done and we continue like before. Spiritual growth is mostly measured in debating or just sitting and listening. There is at times no, very little, interaction with other believers, hopefully we meet some friends. ( A little sarcasm). This is wonderful how Dr Tom has figured that out through his longtime studies, this is true biblical wisdom. Conclusion: We need to know each other, help each other, encourage each other, thinking and praying how to make disciples, building each other up and this is how we edify Christ. Like the world the church has become superficial. And the so-called 'Worship Music' is often so loud that I got onetime almost a panic attack. Many churches attract the young people with loud rock-style music. This is for sure not to be compared with making melody in our hearts and singing psalms. TKS so much Dr. Wadsworth!

They still went to the temple in Jerusalem and if allowed went to local synagogues, while also going to the Messianic (Christian) gatherings on the first day of the week. Adaptations occurred over time in mixed Jewish-Gentile congregations. The model was still the synagogue where scripture commentary, prayer, and psalms were carried out (and also the common table sharing of the Eucharist). Of course, the growth of numbers led to the creation of separate buildings and more structured services. Adaptation to new circumstances and way to carry forward the gospel are not necessarily wrong.</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">Thank you Dr Wadsworth for this presentation - it has really resonated with me and shown the real difference between religion and true Christianity - I' so glad I'm part of a small house group of about ten people, this has changed my whole outlook! God bless you!</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">I thought I might be going mad in my thinking about worship but, even if I am, I now know I'm not alone. Thank you for first undertaking all those years of work and now sharing your findings so clearly. I wonder, if we'd kept the focus on building up each other up, and not on the pulpit or piano, would we have had all the scandals that are now coming to light?</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">Much depends on what denomination or biblical outlook a home group is affiliated with. I have belonged to home groups that were organized for a purpose of a larger church or specific belief system. Then dissolved as the larger church dissolved or else people naturally aged out or "graduated" or moved on from the larger church. They needed supervision or pastoral oversight to stay intact. I could make recommendations of newer churches offering home group concepts but I do not want to get off-topic from the host's intentions and beliefs. These days, my special interest home-groups are on-line. Some are local, others are national or international.</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Apple SD Gothic Neo', Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">Just finished session # 2 and really quite blown away. I have difficulties imagining what our church should or could look like instead. Where edifying one another is the key focus. In our church we spend 8 minutes or so praying for bullet points up at the front. The focus is mostly for our community &amp; missions. We r encouraged to pray with those around us but few turn around to pray with others because we are seemingly too shy or it&rsquo;s too personal. As I reflect on my worship singing in church it&rsquo;s mostly about gratitude and praising Him for all He has done for me. Our Triune God deserves our praise has been a huge theme. Does he not want/need our praise? Or should that be done more in private? Perhaps the rest of the series will help me. Thinking home churches or in our case &ldquo;life groups&rdquo; is ideal in edifying one another and yet what about teens ministry or kids ministry &hellip; I think our teens/kids do small group stuff on a Sunday morning or weekday so thats wonderful.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">Scholars are the ones that have created this problem. We need more people that are lead by the Holy Spirit. In today&rsquo;s society Peter and most of the disciples would have been considered uneducated men.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">I'm not a scholar, but my private studies have led me to this same conclusion</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">Yes! It doesn't take a scholar to understand these things. But it does require an open mind and a diligent effort to study the Bible in the context in which it was written.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">Nice work. You got a PhD for a study I did for myself back in the mid 1990's with bible on CDROM. That was a long time ago. I've come to the conclusion that this "worship service" culture will never change because it serves the business of the church, and churches are businesses. "Worship service" is how they control people and keep them addicted to their product, which is hypnotherapy that makes the attenders feel good about God and Jesus for the next week. The control started when Constantine took over the East, and the civil government and Christianity became one and the same. The government just brought Christianity into their existing population control apparatus. The government control went away during the Enlightenment, but the control mechanisms and methods, and the professional class that benefit from them lived on, with the addition of the persuasion skills made necessary without the backup of government control. Now, as you said, "worship" is a big money industry.</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">Everyone was supposed to bring something. Is that not what Paul was talking about our love feasts? Secondly, they could have distributed the members, once they reach 10, start another fellowship.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;"></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">the post 1996 silence makes sense to me. That's when post-modern church told everyone it was the final form we'd been looking for, and people have been trying to copy it ever since.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">It is a big assumption to believe a focus on God is not primary in the assembly, especially in 1st c. Near East; so primary it needs no instruction. 1 Cor. 14: 26 encourages the gathering believers to each one bring a hymn, an instruction, a revelation, and so on, for the building up of the church. A hymn is certainly liturgical. Paul wrote what many believe to be liturgy in Phil. 2:5-11. But our worship should be a daily life practice Rom. 12:1 and Eph. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;"><a style="color: #065fd4;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw4MTdbq3Xw&amp;t=319s">5:19</a></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">-21. It is a jump to believe this was shelved during times of community. Second, Jesus said, where two or more are gathered in his name, there he would be. How can a believer not worship when she recognizes the presence of our Lord? Third, when a body of believers worship God in spirit and truth, they are edified. Psalms offer many positive examples how that is to be done. And finally, Rev. 5:9-10 provides a vision of the worship of believers in community in Heaven. Let it be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">It's apparent that many lay-people who study the Bible had this figured out decades ago. We just couldn't say anything because then we would be accused of criticizing the pastor. Therefore, we left brick and mortar and started home fellowships. It takes a pastor to teach other pastors so thank you for stepping up. Ordained ministers don't think they have anything to learn from lay persons who have spent their lives studying the Word of the Living God.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0f0f0f; text-align: start;">As I drive merrily around, I&rsquo;m giving this a good listen. It both challenges my preconceptions and answers some questions I&rsquo;ve been pondering for years. I&rsquo;ve long admired the Amish for their not building &ldquo;churches&rdquo; for religious services. They assemble in homes, and spare themselves the expenses of gaudy church edifices. A Greek scholar myself, I&rsquo;ll be researching more about the terms for worship and service. If services were indeed more vertical and less entertaining, it would be a different world indeed. I have a background in &lsquo;worship music&rsquo;, but no longer engage in that. The Jewish rabbis of old supposedly said one hasn&rsquo;t truly worshipped G-d until he has prostrated himself. This seems to go along with what you&rsquo;re teaching. A minister of music friend says she&rsquo;s growing weary of what she calls &ldquo;worshiptainment.&rdquo; I certainly empathize. I&rsquo;ve long suspected that the deep and rich worship of G-d is nothing like the circus-like atmosphere I&rsquo;ve been seeing over the decades. I&rsquo;ll do further study and also bear in my to avoid rash judgment.</span></p>
